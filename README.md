<h1>Abstract</h1>

<h3>Poker represents a challenging task for artificial intelligence research. It is a game of imperfect information where the players deal with difficult statistical elements, the unpredictability of chance, and possible deception. Making the right choice does not always bring immediate profits, but in the long run, poker rewards optimal playing.

This paper describes the architecture of a poker bot in the case of Heads-Up Limit Texas Hold'Em. Apart from being able to evaluate hands, the machine splits them into categories that play out similarly and uses a self-made calculator for preflop odds to create a computable number of game states. Using the Counterfactual Regret Minimization algorithm, the machine goes through trial and error by playing against itself through Reinforcement Learning. After the training, the machine holds probabilities for possible actions at any point in the game, developing a strategy that aims for equilibrium.

The objective of this paper is to develop a poker bot that can effectively defeat a uniform random strategy after playing a considerable amount of hands. This demonstrates that a balanced way of playing is not swayed by luck.</h3>
